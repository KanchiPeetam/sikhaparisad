Pancha kaccham is the highly recommended dressing attire for men. This term derived from the Sanskrit words pancha and gajam meaning five yards. Pancha kaccham is prescribed specifically for Gṛhastha belonging to all four varnas. Pancha kaccham is designed to enable a Gṛhastha to develop in him the right attitude towards Pravruthi Dharma when worn along with Kaupeena and Angavastra (Uthirium). The pancha kaccham simply enables to keep the Prakritic bodily elements tied up and under control. There may be differences in how people from different regions wear pancha kaccham.
