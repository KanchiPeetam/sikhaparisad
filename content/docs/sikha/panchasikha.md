Pañca Śikha is a samskaram performed at the time of upanayanam. This is done before the yagnopaveetha daaranam. During this karma, the boys is head gets shaved except at five spots. These spots signify the four directions (East, West, North, and South) and the top spot represents the adhipati marma.

> Note: The mantras for each direction are same as what is described in [Chaula Karma](https://sikhaparisad.org/docs/sikha/chaulakarma/).

Before the shave, warm water is to be smeared on the head, with the recitation of the
mantra **“ऊष्णेन वाय उदकेनेहि । अदिति: केशान् वपतु”**. Then the hair on the boy’s head is cut in all the four directions by the father reciting the appropriate four mantras to different deities requesting them the long life, fame and wealth for the child. 

The cut hairs are taken into a clay bowl or a plate with cowdung on it and mother sits behind the boy while father standing facing north is reciting the mantra **“यत् क्षुरेण …”** which means don’t lose the life of this boy, while cutting the hair with sharp blade. Then the hairs with the cowdung (in a clay bowl) are disposed of keeping them under the Audumbara tree. After the symbolic shave done by the father, the boy’s head is well shaved by a barbar, and he is given a bath. It is a ceremonial bath, because the mother and the other kith and kins pour the water and he will be purified bodily as well as mentally.
