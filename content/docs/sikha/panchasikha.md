These spots signify the four directions (East, West, North, and South) and the top spot represents the adhipati marma.

Before the shave, hot water is to be smeared on the head, with the recitation of the
mantra **“ऊष्णेन वाय उदकेनेहि । अदिति: केशान् वपतु”**. Then the hair on the boy’s head is cut in all the four directions by the Acarya reciting the appropriate four mantras to different deities requesting them the long life, fame and wealth for the child. 

The cut hairs are taken on a plate with cowdung on it and mother stands by the side of Acarya reciting the mantra **“यत् क्षुरेण …”** which means don’t lose the life of this boy, while cutting the hair with sharp blade. Then the hairs with the cowdung are disposed of keeping them under the Audumbara tree. After the symbolic shave done by the Acarya, the boy’s head is well shaved by a barbar, and he is given a bath. It is a ceremonial bath, because the mother and the other kith and kins pour the water and he will be purified bodily as well as mentally.
